# ❤️ Namaste React Live 🙏

A hands-on journey through the **Namaste React Live Course by Akshay Saini**.  
This repository is my personal collection of **chapter-wise notes** and **coding assignments** — documenting my learning path from basics to advanced React.

---

## 🚀 About the Repository
This repo is structured chapter by chapter.  
Each chapter contains:
- 📝 **Own Notes (.docx)** – my handwritten/digital notes for better revision.  
- 💻 **Coding** – practice assignments, solutions, and experiments.  

The idea is to have both **theory** and **implementation** side-by-side while going through the course.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- ⚛️ **React.js** – Core library for building UI.  
- 🖌️ **HTML & CSS** – Structure and styling.  
- 📦 **Parcel.js** – Zero-config bundler.
