Class-Based Components:

You have successfully implemented class-based components (Header, About, UserClass)
Lifecycle methods are being used correctly (componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount)
The state is managed properly within the class components
React Router:

Your routing structure in App.js is set up correctly
You have routes for homepage, about, contact, and restaurant details
Header with Login Functionality:

Your Header.js has been converted to a class component
The login/logout functionality works with the form modal
User GitHub API Integration:

UserClass.js fetches and displays GitHub user data
It uses proper lifecycle methods for API calls
Restaurant Data:

Body.js (now class-based) handles restaurant data fetching and filtering
RestaurantCard.js properly handles empty image URLs
Everything seems to be correctly implemented for the "Let's get classy" chapter of your course. The code shows good understanding of React class components and their lifecycle methods. The project should be functioning as expected.
